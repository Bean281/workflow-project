## ü§ì Introduction:

  **Purpose**:

  The purpose of our web app is to provide a simple and effective tool to help users manage their time and increase productivity. The app combines two essential         features - note-taking and a Pomodoro-style timer - to help users stay focused and organized throughout their workday.
  
  **Target Audience:**:
  
  Our web app is designed for anyone who wants to improve their productivity, whether they are students, professionals, or freelancers. It will be particularly useful   for those who often find themselves distracted or struggling to stay on task. The note-taking feature is perfect for those who need to jot down quick ideas or         reminders, while the Pomodoro timer is ideal for those who want to break up their workday into manageable chunks and take regular breaks to avoid burnout.


- The project consist of various application such as:


  - **Notetaking**:

    1. Creating Notes üìù: The app should provide users with an easy-to-use interface for creating new notes. Users should be able to add a title and content for each note, as well as saving date when the note was created.

    2. Editing Notes üíæ: Users should be able to edit their existing notes at any time. This should include the ability to modify the note's title, content.

    3. Deleting Notes üöÆ: Users should be able to delete individual notes or multiple notes at once. The app should provide a confirmation prompt before permanently deleting any notes to prevent accidental deletions.

    4. Searching üîé: The app should allow users to search for specific notes by keyword.
    

  - **Personal account**:

    1. Creating an Account üëå: The app should provide a straightforward and secure registration process for new users, requiring them to create a unique username and password.

    2. Logging In and Out üö™: Once registered, users should be able to log in to their account using their username and password. The app should also provide a "logout" button that allows users to securely log out of their account when they are finished using the app.

    3. Account Information Management üìö: Users should be able to manage their account information, such as changing their password, updating their email address or other personal information. The app should provide a simple interface for users to make these changes, with appropriate validation to ensure that any changes are accurate and secure.

    4. Deactivation and Account Removal ‚ùå: Users should have the option to deactivate or delete their account if they no longer wish to use the app. The app should provide a straightforward process for users to do this, with appropriate warnings and confirmation steps to prevent accidental deletion of accounts.


  - **Study timer**:

    1. Countdown Timer ‚åõ: The app should provide a countdown timer that counts down from a set amount of time, such as 25 minutes, and emits a sound or notification when the timer reaches zero.

    2. Tasks workout üí™: The app allowed the user to add tasks under the timer and check whenever the deed is finished.

    3. Pause and Resume ‚è∏: The app should allow users to pause and resume the timer as needed, in case of interruptions or unexpected events.

## Conclusion and the lessons learned from working with the team on the projects:
 - Working together as a team on our web development project was an invaluable learning experience. Throughout the project, we were exposed to and gained knowledge in a wide range of areas, including HTML, CSS, Java, JavaServlet, and most imporantly the implementation of the MVC2 model to design the flow of the web application. Additionally, we had the opportunity to develop our skills in using GitHub as a version control platform gaining more experience in the future application. Overall, it was an incredibly fulfilling and educational endeavor for all of us.
 - Communication is gotta be the toughest challenge, it's one the key aspect of controlling the workflow of the entire team and we've failed miserably at a couple of hours from the beginning or sometimes in other areas.However, through hardship and endeavour which lead us taste the true fruit of our own and it was filled with glory, giving us a chance to see the fond of working together and opportunities to find interest in programming.
 - From a team perspective, we found the project to be both challenging and rewarding. While there were many moments of frustration, facing many issue during the process and encounter errors that many of us only see for the first time: conflict of code, wrong upload, etc.. But being able to see our ideas come to life on the web was incredibly satisfying and everything was well worth it. We also appreciated the opportunity to work collaboratively with each other and learn from each other's different perspectives.
 - For future improvements, there are a few areas that we could focus on as a team. For example, we could conduct more user testing to enhance user experience. Make the code more optimize, add more function to it.
 - In conclusion, the web development project was a valuable learning experience that allowed us to develop new skills and gain knowledge in various areas. While there were many mistakes, we are proud of what we were able to achieve as a team. We learned that effective communication and collaboration are essential for successful project outcomes as well as a strong coding base and understanding of what you are working on.

Thank you teacher for everything, for shining the light for us to move on the correct path to pursuit.
